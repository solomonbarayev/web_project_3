                  Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on
                  the shores of the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their
                  right mind would swim in the river, unless they grew up here,
                  in which case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers
                  are hot here, and the winters are drafty, but the fall and the
                  spring are are absolutely amazing.

                <p class="place__paragraph">
                  The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and
                  soviet architecture, all of it sprinkled with modified
                  balconies. If you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the
                  landscape is difficult to traverse for people on bikes and
                  those wearing heels. The left bank is considered far less
                  interesting and prestigious though, even by people who live on
                  the far outskirts of the right one.

                  The medieval ruin of Cricieth Castle overlooks the town below
                  from a rock that juts out into the sea. It is thought to have
                  been built by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th century. Some 900
                  years later, the self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of
                  Snowdonia has become a popular tourist destination during the

                  ingredient is rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. Another
                  claim to fame is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom
                  award for five years in a row for its spectacular floral
                  displays around town. It was also home to David Lloyd George,

                  Berea is a small town located in the central part of Kentucky.

                  It's known as the arts and crafts capital of the state, and
                  visitors will find plenty of shopping opportunities: shops
                  with handmade jewelry, candles, wood items, galleries, glass

                  celebrating "spoonbread", a local dish made with cornbread and
                  served with a wooden spoon.

                  However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea

                  south to be racially integrated, as well as the first to be
                  coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no tuition —
                  every student receives a full-tuition scholarship.

                  province. But that cool breeze allows for one of the largest
